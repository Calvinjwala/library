# Git

- [Changing Author Info](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-author-info/)
I often will accidentally write a ton of commits on my work git account. This will correct all of those, assuming you're the only person on the repo.

- [Set a Local Git Author](http://www.thebuzzmedia.com/git-tip-git-config-user-name-and-user-email-for-local-not-global-config/)
Similar deal as above: set a local git user (your person, for example) in personal repos on your work computer.
