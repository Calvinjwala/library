- [Stanford Course](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-8-apps-swift/id961180099): I generally don't have the patience for this sort of thing but the Stanford course is really well laid out and the professor has years of experience teaching this course in Objective-C and has it down to a science (I mean, he is a Stanford professor).I can recommend it with confidence even for those who don't like the traditional college course model because you can take it at your leisure for free.
