# iOS Development

## Tutorial
- [Push Notifications](http://www.raywenderlich.com/32960/apple-push-notification-services-in-ios-6-tutorial-part-1)

## Tools
- [Node Push Notification Library](https://github.com/argon/node-apn): Great push notification library - worked as sort of a copy & paste-type situation for me which was pretty great. Also in combination with Ray Wenderlich's tutorial above, generating the keys was pretty simple using [their documentation](https://github.com/argon/node-apn/wiki/Preparing-Certificates).
