# Library
If you're anything like me you have too many bookmarks, an overflowing Pocket, and a bunch of other things that are probably working organizing in some fashion. This is my attempt to wrestle that beast. Welcome to my library.

### Command Line
I use [iTerm2](http://iterm2.com/), [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/), and the [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) theme [halloween](https://github.com/helenvholmes/dotfiles/blob/master/halloween.zsh-theme), which I modded from [cloud](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/themes/cloud.zsh-theme). I go more into mods and stuff in [Terminal](command-line/terminal.md).

- [Git](command-line/git.md): Resources for everyone's favorite version control from yours truly.
- [Markdown](command-line/markdown.md): Favorite documentation writing style of most developers, and also how one writes READMEs for Github.
- [Terminal](command-line/terminal.md): How to make your bland, boring terminal a lot nicer.
- [Vim](command-line/vim.md): A confusing, monolithic editor that people like using so they can brag about it. It's worth learning a few commands so that you can quickly edit things on the command line.

### Design
I mostly do web design but I've done a lot of other things as well - mobile app design, branding, print design, photography, drawing, and craftier things like DIY projects. I was a long time Adobe fan but lately I've been pretty enthralled with [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) for UI design and [Framer Studio](http://framerjs.com/) for prototyping. For photography I still find myself using [Lightroom](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html) and for drawing I've mostly been using [Paper53](https://www.fiftythree.com/paper) and [Paper53's pencil](http://www.fiftythree.com/pencil).

- [Icons](design/icons.md): Lots of nice vector icon sets, some of which are free.
- [Photography](design/photos.md): Stock photography resources.
- [Sound](design.sound.md): Resources for sounds.
