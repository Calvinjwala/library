# Library
If you're anything like me, you have hundreds of bookmarks, an overflowing list on [Pocket](http://getpocket.com/), and a bunch of other shit you don't feel like organizing but is useful (namely, the [SO](http://stackoverflow.com/) posts on how to do that git thing, what was it?, let me google it). Well, fuck this shit! Writing in Markdown is fun, so let's get to it.
