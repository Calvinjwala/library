# Library
If you're anything like me, you have hundreds of bookmarks, an overflowing list on [Pocket](http://getpocket.com/), and a bunch of other shit you don't feel like organizing but is useful (namely, the [SO](http://stackoverflow.com/) posts on how to do that git thing, what was it?, let me google it). Well, fuck this shit! Writing in Markdown is fun, so let's get to it.

# Front-End

# Design

# Command Line
- [Git](command-line/git.md): Resources for your favorite version control, yours truly.
- [Markdown](command-line/markdown.md): Once you go 'down you never go... back? Idek. 
- [Terminal](command-line/terminal.md): Pimp that shit out, yo, you always be in it.
- [Vim](command-line/vim.md): If you use it, you can brag about it to all your friends.
- [Sublime Text](command-line/sublime.md): For when you actually need to get work done instead of running around like a chicken when your head cut off.
