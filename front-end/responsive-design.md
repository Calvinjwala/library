# Responsive Design
A website should work on you rphone, on your tablet, on your computer, on your enomrous 5k retina display, and the user should be able to do what they want to do.

## Library
- [Responsive Design Resources](http://bradfrost.github.io/this-is-responsive/resources.html): Better round-up than anything I can put here, I assure you.
- [Screen Sizes](http://screensiz.es/phone): Less important as we begin to build for any size, but a good way to convince others they should let you build something the right way.
