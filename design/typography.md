# Typography

## Library
- [Typography Basics](http://www.infor.uva.es/~descuder/docencia/IG/letterform_anatomy.pdf): No-nonsense explanation of letterforms. Weirdly, it's from one of my alma maters (not known for design).

## Beautiful Fonts
- [Calendas Plus](http://calendasplus.com/): Gorgeous ligatures, pretty fucking obsessed right now.
- [Shift Fort](http://mckl.webtype.com/): Huge font family.
