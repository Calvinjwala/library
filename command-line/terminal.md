# Terminal 

## Library
- [lsof Survival Guide](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/106234/lsof-survival-guide): Kill ports, find PIDs, etc.

## Tools
- [iTerm2](http://iterm2.com/): iTerm is nicer than the regular terminal [for a lot of reasons](http://iterm2.com/features.html). It also feels exactly the same if you're antsy about switching over, so that's nice.

- [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh): Themes and apps for the terminal. I was using the [cloud theme](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) for a while but I wanted to be Halloween-y so I made a [Halloween theme](https://github.com/hlnvhlms/dotfiles/blob/master/halloween.zsh-theme) for myself that you're welcome to check out. (Watch out, I'm still planning to make it better.)
