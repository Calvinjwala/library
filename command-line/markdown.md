# Markdown
Favorite tool for writing. Also check out [Applications](../mac/applications.md) for my favorite programs to use it with.

## Cheatsheet
- [Github Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/): This is the most common markdown syntax I use, so I reference this page a lot.

## Tools
- [Escrit.es](http://ecrit.es/): Markdown in the browser.
- ```data:text/html, <html contenteditable>```: type this in the browser's URL bar, get an editor.
- [Dillinger](http://dillinger.io/): An in-browser Markdown editor built with Angular that's quite nice.
