# Markdown
My favorite syntax for writing. I've also cross-referenced some things from [Applications](../mac/applications.md) in the tools section.

## Cheatsheet
- [Github Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/): This is the most common markdown syntax I use, so I reference this page a lot.

## Tools
- [iAWriter](https://ia.net/writer/mac/): Hands down my favorite tool for writing Markdown. Looks great, works great, and syncs with iCloud so you can write on your iPad and iPhone too.
- [MacDown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/): Side-by-side editing for Markdown, which is great for code documentation. I prefer it over Mou because it's less of an energy hog.
- [Escrit.es](http://ecrit.es/): Markdown in the browser.
- ```data:text/html, <html contenteditable>```: type this in the browser's URL bar, get an editor.
- [Dillinger](http://dillinger.io/): An in-browser Markdown editor built with Angular that's quite nice.
